" Whats is software?
Ans-software is collection of program.

" Whats is program?
Ans- Program is collection of instruction.

" Types of Software?
Ans-
1> System Software.
** wo software jo computer ko run karte hai like os,linker,compiler,loader,driver (To create system software c, c++, vc++ etc)

2> Aplication Software
** Aise software jo specific user ke liye banaye jaete hai(windows, desktop, like tally, kundali,sap
front end> vb, d2k, vb.net,
backend software for storage data like sql, oracle, db2)

3> Web apllication
** wo software jinko run karne ke liye internet required hota hai. Like website web apllication based on internet (html,css,php,java)

4> Device application [mobile application android and iso]
** Android application > JAVA,
** IOS Application > Swift

5> AI/IOT Application.[IOT = INTERNET OF THINGS]
** to make Ai and Iot appllication to use python.

###Python is not suitaible for device application.

====>> Versions of python <<====

> Pyhton Programming contains 2 types of versions....
[A] Python 2.x, x Represents 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
[B] Python 3.x, x Represents 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12

====>>> (DAY-3)  Features of Python Programming  <<====

*** Feature of any programming langauge are nothing but service provided by language developer in language and thrye are used by launguage programmer and they are used in real time application.


*** Python programming porvide 11 features they are 
1)  Simple programming
2)  Freeware and Open source
3)  Platform independend and portable 
4)  Dynamically typed 
5)  Interpreted 
6)  High level 
7)  Robust (Strong programming langauge) Exception handling
8)  Both functional object programming language
9)  Extensible
10) Embedded programming
11) Support third party APIs-Numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit,  matplotlib
12) 

??? Define python in one line ???
1. python is open source, freeware procedure + function + object oriented, and platform independed

====>>> (DAY-4)    <<====

Why Simple
1. Simple >> 
python is one of the  prgramming langauge becoz IMPORTANT of 3 tech factors. the are,
(i)     PYTHON programming provides "rich set of APIs" so that python programmer can re-use predefine code without writing own code. 
    
    API "application programing interface"
    
    :> An API is collection of Module.  module is a collection of function, Variable and classes.
    Example Module - cmath, math, caledar, random etc

(ii)    Python programming provides in-built facility called "Garbage collector" so that it can run behide of python program for collecting un used memmory and  improve performance of python based application.

:> def. Garbage collectore;
A garbage collector is one of the python background program which is running behind of every python program and whose
